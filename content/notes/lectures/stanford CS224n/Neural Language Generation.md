### Formalizing NLG: a simple model and training algorithm

- ÏûêÏó∞Ïñ¥ ÏÉùÏÑ±Ïùò Í∏∞Ï¥à
	- In autoregressive text generation models, at each time step $t$, our model takes in a sequence of tokens of text as input $\{y\}_{<t}$ and outputs a new token, ${\hat{y}}_t$.
	- ![](notes/lectures/stanford%20CS224n/image/cs224n_1.png)
	- At each time step $t$, our model computes a vector of scores for each token in our vocabulary, $S \in \mathbb{R}^V$:
	  $$S = f(\{y_{<t}\}, \theta)$$
	- Then, we compute a probability distribution $ùëÉ$ over $w \in V$ using these scores:
	  $$P(y_t = w | \{y_{<t}\}) = {{exp(S_w)} \over {\sum_{w'\in V} exp(S_{w'})}}$$
- **What are we trying to do?**
	- At each time step $t$, our model computes a vector of scores for each token in our vocabulary, $S \in \mathbb{R}^V$). Then, we compute a probability distribution $P$  over $w \in V$ using these scores:

	- At inference time, our decoding algorithm defines a function to select a token from this distribution:
	  $${\hat{y_t}} = g(P(y_t|\{y_{<t}\})$$
	  - In the equation above, $\color{red}g(\cdot)$ is your decoding algorithm.
	  - We train the model to minimize **the [Negative loglikelihood](notes/lectures/stanford%20CS224n/Neural%20Language%20Generation/Negative%20loglikelihood.md) of predicting the next token in the sequence**:
	    $$L_t = -logP(y_t^* | \{y_{<t}^*\})$$
	- The label at each step is the actual word $\color{blue}y_t^*$ in the training sequence.
	- This token is often called the ‚Äúgold‚Äù or ‚Äúground truth‚Äù token.

	- Trained to generate the next word $\color{blue}y_t^*$ given a set of preceding words $\color{red}\{y_{<t}^*\}$.

### Decoding from NLP models
- Our decoding algorithm defines a function to select a token from this distribution:
  $${\hat{y_t}} = {\color{blue}g}(P(y_t|\{y_{<t}\})$$

  ![](notes/images/Ïä§ÌÅ¨Î¶∞ÏÉ∑%202023-03-15%20Ïò§Ï†Ñ%2012.30.34.png)
- **Greedy methods**
	- ==Argmax Decoding== 
		- Selects the highest probability token in $P(y_t|y_{<t})$
		  $${\hat{y_t}} = {\color{red}argmax_{w \in V}}P(y_t = w | y_{<t})$$
	- ==Beam Search== 
		- Also a greedy algorithm, but with wider search over candidate
	- **Í∑∏Îü¨ÎÇò Greedy methodsÎäî repetitive ÏúÑÌóòÏù¥ ÎÜíÎã§.**
	- **Ïñ¥ÎñªÍ≤å repetitionÏùÑ Ï§ÑÏùº Ïàò ÏûàÏùÑÍπå?**
		- Simple option: "Don't repeat n-grams"
		- More complex:
			- Minimize embedding distance between consecutive sentences (`Celikyilmaz et al., 2018`)
			- Coverage loss (`See et al., 2017`)
			- Unlikelihood objective (`Welleck et al., 2020`)
- ==Decoding: [Top-k sampling](notes/lectures/stanford%20CS224n/Neural%20Language%20Generation/Top-k%20sampling.md)==
	- **Problem**: Vanilla sampling makes every token in the vocabulary an option
		- Even if most of the probability mass in the distribution is over a limited set of options, **the tail of the distribution could be very long**
		- Many tokens are probably irrelevant in the current context
		- Why are we giving them *individually* a tiny chance to be selected?
		- Why are we giving them *as a group* a high chance to be selected?
	- **Solution**: Top-k sampling
		- **Only sample from the top *k* tokens in the probability distribution**.
		- Increase *k* for more **diverse/risky** outputs
		- Decrease *k* for more **generic/safe** outputs
		  ![](notes/images/Ïä§ÌÅ¨Î¶∞ÏÉ∑%202023-03-15%20Ïò§ÌõÑ%203.32.22.png)
		- Top-k sampling can cut off *too quickly*!

		- Top-k sampling can also cut off *too slowly*!

- ==Decoding: [Top-p sampling](notes/lectures/stanford%20CS224n/Neural%20Language%20Generation/Top-p%20sampling.md)==
	- Îì±Ïû• Î∞∞Í≤Ω: **The probability distributions we sample from are dynamic.**
		- When the distribution $P_t$ is **flatter**, a limited $k$ removes many viable options.
		- When the distribution $P_t$ is **peakier**, a high $k$ allows for too many options to have a chance of being selecte.
	- Ïù¥ Î¨∏Ï†úÎ•º Ìï¥Í≤∞Ìï† Î∞©Î≤ï: **Top-p sampling**
		- Sample from all tokens in **the top $p$ cumulative probability mass** (i.e., where mass is concentrated).
		- Varies k depending on the uniformity of $P_t$.
		  ![](notes/images/Ïä§ÌÅ¨Î¶∞ÏÉ∑%202023-03-15%20Ïò§ÌõÑ%203.39.10.png)
  - Scaling **randomness**: ==[Softmax temperature](notes/lectures/stanford%20CS224n/Neural%20Language%20Generation/Softmax%20temperature.md)==
	  - You can apply **a temperature hyperparameter $\tau$** to the softmax to rebalance $P_t$!
	    $$P_t(y_t = w) = {{exp({\color{blue}S_w / \tau})} \over {\sum_{w'\in V} exp({\color{blue}S_{w'/ \tau}})}}$$
	- Raise the temperature $\tau$  > 1: $P_t$ becomes **more uniform**
		- **More diverse output** (probability is spread around vocab)
	- Lower the temperature $\tau$  < 1: $P_t$ becomes **more spiky** 
		- **Less diverse output** (probability is concentrated on top words 
> [!warning] Note  
>   
> Softmax temperature is *not* a decoding algorithm! It‚Äôs a technique you can apply at test time, in conjunction with a decoding algorithm (such as beam search or sampling)

> [!note] Decoding: Takeaways  
>   
> - Decoding is still a challenging problem in natural language generation
> - Human language distribution is noisy and doesn‚Äôt reflect simple properties (i.e., *probability maximization*)
> - Different decoding algorithms can allow us to inject biases that encourage different properties of coherent natural language generation
> - Some of the most impactful advances in NLG of the last few years have come from simple, but effective, modifications to decoding algorithms

### Training NLG models
- **Maximum Likelihood Training** (i.e., teacher forcing)
	- Trained to generate the next word $\color{blue}y_t^*$ given a set of preceding words $\color{red}\{y_{<t}^*\}$.
	- Diversity Issues
		- Maximum Likelihood Estimation *discourages* diverse text generation.
- **[Unlikelihood training](notes/lectures/stanford%20CS224n/Neural%20Language%20Generation/Unlikelihood%20training.md)**
	- Given a set of undesired tokens $C$, **lower their likelihood in context.**
	  $$L_{UL}^t = -\sum_{y_{neg} \in C} log(1-P(y_{neg} | {y^*}_{<t}))$$
	- Keep teacher forcing objective and **combine them** for final loss function.
	  $$L_{MLE}^t = -\sum_{t=1} logP(y_t^* | {y^*}_{<t})$$
	  $$L_{ULE}^t = L_{MLE}^t + aL_{UL}^t$$
	- Set $C = {y^*}_{<t}$ and you‚Äôll train the model **to lower the likelihood of previously-seen tokens!**
		- Limits repetition!
		- Increases the diversity of the text you learn to generate.
- ==[Exposure bias](notes/lectures/stanford%20CS224n/Neural%20Language%20Generation/Exposure%20bias.md)==
	- **Training with teacher forcing leads to exposure bias at generation time**
	- During training, our model‚Äôs inputs are gold context tokens from real, human-generated texts.
	  $$L_{MLE} = -logP(y_t^* | {\color{red}{y^*}_{<t}})$$
	  - At generation time, our model‚Äôs inputs are previously‚Äìdecoded tokens.
	    $$L_{dec} = -logP(\hat{y}_t | {\color{blue}\hat{y}_{<t}})$$![](notes/images/Ïä§ÌÅ¨Î¶∞ÏÉ∑%202023-03-15%20Ïò§ÌõÑ%205.16.25.png)
	- **Exposure Bias Solutions**
		- Scheduled sampling (Bengio et al., 2015)
		- Dataset Aggregation (DAgger; Ross et al., 2011)
		- Sequence re-writing (Guu*, Hashimoto* et al., 2018)
		- ==Reinforcement Learning==: cast your text generation model as a Markov decision process
			- **State** $s$ is the model‚Äôs representation of the preceding context
			- **Actions** $a$ are the words that can be generated
			- **Policy** $\pi$ is the decoder
			- **Rewards** $r$ are provided by an external score
			- Learn behaviors by rewarding the model when it exhibits them.
			- *REINFORCE*: Basic
				- Sample a sequence from your model
				- Next time, increase the probability of this sampled token in the same context.
				- ‚Ä¶but do it more **if I get a high reward from the reward function**.
				  $$L_{RL} = -\sum_{t=1}^T {\color{red}r(\hat{y_t})}logP(\hat{y}_t | y^*;{\color{blue}\{\hat{y_t}\}_{<t}})$$![](notes/images/Ïä§ÌÅ¨Î¶∞ÏÉ∑%202023-03-15%20Ïò§ÌõÑ%205.22.42.png)
			  - **Reward Estimation**
				  - How should we define a reward function? Just use your evaluation metric!
				  - **BLEU** (machine translation; Ranzato et al., ICLR 2016; Wu et al., 2016)
				  - **ROUGE** (summarization; Paulus et al., ICLR 2018; Celikyilmaz et al., NAACL 2018)
				  - **CIDEr** (image captioning; Rennie et al., CVPR 2017)
				  - **SPIDEr** (image captioning; Liu et al., ICCV 2017)
			  - **The dark side‚Ä¶**
				  - Need to pretrain a model with *teacher forcing* **before** doing RL training
					  - Your reward function probably expects coherent language inputs‚Ä¶ 
				  - Need to set an appropriate **baseline**
				    $$L_{RL} = -\sum_{t=1}^T {\color{red}r(\hat{y_t} - b)}logP(\cdots)$$
				- Use linear regression to predict it from the state $s$ (Ranzato et al., 2015)
				- Decode a second sequence and use its reward as the **baseline** (Rennie et al., 2017)

> [!note] Training: Takeaways  
>   
>  - **Teacher forcing** is still the premier algorithm for training text generation models 
>  - **Diversity** is an issue with sequences generated from teacher forced models
> 	 - New approaches focus on mitigating the effects of common words
>  - **Exposure bias** causes text generation models to lose coherence easily
> 	 - Models must learn to recover from their own bad samples (e.g., scheduled sampling, DAgger)
> 	 - Or not be allowed to generate bad text to begin with (e.g., retrieval + generation)
>  - Training with **RL** can allow models to learn behaviors that are challenging to formalize
> 	 - Learning can be very **unstable**.

### [Evaluating NLG systems](notes/lectures/stanford%20CS224n/Neural%20Language%20Generation/Evaluating%20NLG%20systems.md)

- Types of evaluation methods for text generation
	- Content overlap metrics
	- Model-based Metrics
	- Human Evaluations
- ==Content overlap metrics==
	- Compute a score that indicates the similarity between *generated* and *gold-standard* (human-written) text
	- Fast and efficient and widely used
	- Two broad categories:
		- **N-gram overlap metrics** (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, CIDEr, etc.)
			- *They‚Äôre not ideal for machine translation.*
		- **Semantic overlap metrics** (e.g., PYRAMID, SPICE, SPIDEr, etc.
- ==Model-based metrics==
	- Use **learned representations of words and sentences** to compute semantic similarity between generated and reference texts.
	- **No more n-gram bottleneck** because text units are represented as embeddings!
	- Even though embeddings are **pretrained**, distance metrics used to measure the similarity can be **fixed**.
	- Model-based metrics: **Word distance functions**
		- **Vector Similarity**
			- Embedding Average (Liu et al., 2016)
			- Vector Extrema (Liu et al., 2016)
			- MEANT (Lo, 2017)
			- YISI (Lo, 2019)
		- **Word Mover‚Äôs Distance**
		- **BERT SCORE**
			- Uses pre-trained contextual embeddings from BERT and matches words in candidate and reference sentences by cosine similarity. (Zhang et.al. 2020)
	- Model-based metrics: **Beyond word matching**
		- **Sentence Movers Similarity**
		- **BLEURT**
			- A regression model based on BERT returns a score that indicates to what extend the candidate text is grammatical and conveys the meaning of the reference text. (Sellam et.al. 2020)
- Human evaluations
	- Most important form of evaluation for text generation systems
	- *Ask* humans to evaluate the quality of generated text
> [!warning] Note  
> 
> Don‚Äôt compare human evaluation scores across differently-conducted studies. Even if they claim to evaluate the same dimensions!

- Learning from human feedback
	- ADEM
	- HUSE

> [!note] Evaluation: Takeaways  
>   
>  - **Content overlap metrics** provide a good starting point for evaluating the quality of generated text, but they‚Äôre **not good enough on their own.**
>  - **Model-based metrics** are can be more correlated with human judgment, but behavior is **not interpretable.**
>  - **Human judgments** are critical.
> 	 - Only ones that can directly evaluate **factuality** ‚Äì is the model saying correct things?
> 	 - But humans are **inconsistent**!
>  - In many cases, the best judge of output quality is YOU!
